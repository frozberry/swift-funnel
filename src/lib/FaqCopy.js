          This is a really common concern, but that does not mean it&rsquo;s a
          barrier to success. The truth is, I had to learn all of this myself by

          to guide me.

          So even though it&rsquo;s true that having 24/7 access to badminton
          courts and a personal badminton butler feed you shuttles on demand is
          great. You do NOT need that to get results with the Footwork Fastlane.

          The majority of the lessons are technical lessons. Meaning you can
          develop these skills ANYWHERE, build up the muscle memory, and still
          see huge benefits in matches.

          I know what it feels like to be presented with a big opportunity like

          there&rsquo;s the risk: risk of losing money, risk of losing your

          You&rsquo;ve got 60 days - two full months - to put my entire system

          In the Footwork Fastlane you&rsquo;ll build your footwork from the
          ground up - a process that usually takes months, or even years. And
          instead of trying to piece together conflicting information from 100
          different sources, I will hold your hand and personally take you
          through the entire system.
        </p>
        <p style={answer}>
          On the other hand, YouTube as a platform is more suited for small
          &ldquo;tidbits&rdquo; of information. It&rsquo;s not appropriate for a
          structured, in-depth system like the Footwork Fastlane. This is coming

          The best part of the Footwork Fastlane is the fact that you only need
          about 1-2 hours PER &nbsp;WEEK to get started. If you can dedicate

          That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re able to work on your own schedule,

          Think about it like this: if you tried to learn all this without the
          system (like I had to), you would spend HOURS upon hours researching
          online. You&rsquo;d make a TON of mistakes and frankly, you&rsquo;d
          waste more time.
        </p>
        <p style={answer}>Time that could be better spent.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style={answer}>
          By following the Footwork Fastlane&rsquo;s step&shy;-by-&shy;step

          It&rsquo;s been designed so you can get as much value as possible even

        <p style={answer}>Of course not.</p>

          Footwork is a fundamental technique that&rsquo;s universally
