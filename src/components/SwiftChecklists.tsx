        Most online programs don&apos;t work because there&apos;s no way to get
        feedback. Since you don&apos;t know if you&apos;re making mistakes, you
        could be learning the wrong thing that ends up <b>hurting</b> your game!

      <Typography variant="body1">
        I took care of that by creating my proprietary Swift Checklists. This
        makes the process in the Footwork Fastlane even <em>better</em> than
        having a real coach.

        The Swift Checklists are self assessment tools designed to give you
        personalised feedback. Powered by Google Forms, this is my way of
        “automating” the coaching and feedback process.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        Each checklist is designed to point out any mistakes you may be unaware
        that you’re making. And giving you personalised feedback in order to
        correct them. You literally won’t find anything comparable to the Swift
        Checklist anywhere else.
